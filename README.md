## 🛡️ Mission Briefing
The **Starfarer's PADD** is a single-file, offline-capable media console designed for long-haul travel. It mimics the LCARS/Sci-Fi aesthetic of 24th-century hardware while providing a robust engine for three distinct media types: **Music**, **Audiobooks**, and **Text Data**.

Built by the **SageWire Syndicate**, this tool uses **Zero External Dependencies**. It runs entirely in your browser using the Web Audio API and IndexedDB storage.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. The Tri-Corder System
Three dedicated operating modes tailored to specific media:
* **[ LOGS ] Mode:** Optimized for Audiobooks. Features auto-bookmarking (resumes exactly where you left off), 15s/30s time jumps, and pitch-corrected speed control.
* **[ MUSIC ] Mode:** A high-fidelity Jukebox. Features Playlist Shuffle, Loop, and a 3-Band Tactical EQ (Bass/Vocal/Leveler).
* **[ TEXT ] Mode:** A Text-to-Speech terminal. Upload `.txt` or `.md` files, and the PADD's synthetic voice will read them aloud while you work.

### 2. Tactical Audio Engine
* **Warp Core Generator:** A built-in Brown Noise synthesizer. Turn this on to drown out background noise and focus.
* **Signal Leveler:** A dynamic compressor that balances volume spikes in poorly mixed audio files.
* **Visualizer:** A real-time spectral analyzer that reacts to the frequency of your audio.

### 3. System Integration
* **Lock Screen Control:** Uses the Media Session API to let you play/pause/skip from your phone's lock screen.
* **Adaptive Camouflage:** Four selectable color themes (Scarlet, Day Ops, Cryo, Night Vision) to match your environment.
